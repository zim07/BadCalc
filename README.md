## GUIs are overrated!

Why have comforting buttons? Why have sleek, elegent, and modern buttons when no one will appriciate all of that hard work that was put in by the intern on tuesday night to make sure that the equal sign was perfectly aligned? Well fear not, CLIs are here to save the day! Save on your precious resources such as ram and floppy drive space, you need to maximize every cpu cycle you are given to give our users a better and faster experiance. Why use a mouse when you can save those precious seconds by just typing out the equation? You know what, to hell with GUIs, who needs preety visuals anyways, just print out the results and fill out that spreadsheet with a quill and ink like a man shorty!

(the intern escaped confinment and locked editing on the readme file)
